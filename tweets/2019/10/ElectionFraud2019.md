Caution when voting: SOMETHING FISHY IS GOING ON IN TORONTO

I just finished voting. First of all the polls were supposed to open at 9:00 am, my area (Toronto) wasn't open until 9:45 am. Inside the situation was CHAOTIC. I have seen more organized voting in a third world country. This was absolutely atrocious how chaotic it was in there. If I was a conspiracy guy I would say it was by design.

Anyways the ballot is old school simple x marks the spot. No instructions how to hand it in but I did it like I remember, I folded it and was instructed not to put it directly in the box but to hand it to the clerk. When I did he opened it up exposing my vote to himself and to those waiting to vote but , and big but, as he "refolded" my ballot he smudged the heavy pencil all across the other circles so my x was gone and it just looked like one big smudge mark across all ballots. It was clear my ballow would be considered "spoiled" and I asked for a new one and I didn't want anyone seeing my vote of fucking with it once I was done. Of course no one, many who barely spoke English, knew what to do so they had to phone a supervisor who DECLINED another ballot. So there goes my vote. Problem is , this place was crowded and we noticed that the ballots coming back that did not vote for the ruling party were all "spoiled" by the same method but the ballots voting for the ruling party were all a ok and folded properly so they didn't need "refolding" or smudging.

It's fucked up. Somebody tried to take video and pics and of course that's illegal so the cops were called. I am 100% sure the Liberals win my riding. No doubt about it. So be careful and be ready for a fucking chaotic shit hole situation.

PLEASE RE-POST THIS TO AS MANY CANADIANS AS YOU CAN. #wedonotconsent #electionfraud2019 #stand4freedom #endthecharade
